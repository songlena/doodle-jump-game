README Doodle Jump
Overview:

The purpose of this program is to create a game where doodle (the rectangle that is controlled by key presses A and D)
can jump on four different types of platforms. As the doodle jumps, score increases based off of how much the
doodle scrolls. Once doodle reaches a certain height on the screen, the platforms scroll down, giving the illusion
that doodle has leveled up to a new height. This program features the App class, DoodleOrganizer(to organize the panes),
Game, Doodle, Constants, Platform, and four subclasses of Platform (MovingPlatform, ExtraBouncePlatform,
StandardPlatform, and DisappearingPlatform). Constants is used to minimize and simplify code. The Platform has four
subclasses because there are four different types of platforms that have slightly different functions for collide.
We generate the four different types of platforms by using a switch method with multiple cases and a random number
generator. Once doodle falls and goes off the screen, the game ends, the timeline stops, and the A and D keys can no
longer be pressed. This is when "Game Over" is displayed on the screen.

Design Choices:

For inheritance, we decided to create one parent class called Platform and four subclasses that inherited from the
main Platform class. This is because the platforms are still somewhat similar (size-wise), but they have different
collide functions that need to be written individually. We created a DoodleOrganizer class to organize the panes in
the game, then created an instance of Game in our organizer class. Game is responsible for containing the timeline,
platform array, and doodle (basically all the elements that make up the doodle jump game). We created an arraylist
that stored platforms and wrote the genPlatform() method in Game to set the location randomly of new platforms
generated. We also created the method gameUpdate(), which is called in the timeline and updated constantly throughout
the game. In gameUpdate(), we call other methods written in Game like checkCollision(), checkScroll(), and
removePlatforms().
